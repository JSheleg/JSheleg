# Hey I am Jessica Sheleg

  Started off my career as a Mechanical Engineer with coding experience in C++ and Java from my BS in Engineering.
  After experience in Manfuacturing, Education and Sales, I decided to follow my passion to make a career change into Tech. 
  In January 2021, I started a certificate program in Data Science with a focus in Machine Learning using Python. 
  In April, I started a Full-Stack web development program with a focus on the MERN stack through [University of Texas Austin](https://techbootcamps.utexas.edu/coding/).
  Having graduated in October 2021, I am building my skills through personal projects and any opportunties that come along. 

  Update 2025 - I have been working since April 2022 as a software engineer focused in Machine Learning and Model Deployment. In my day job I have dabbled in AWS, Terraform, Python, Data Science, Model   
  deployment and some Java. I have been taking some time away from coding but have finally started to get back to my own passion projects. If you have any suggestions for projects, or feedback on any 
  recent projects or notebooks, please reach out. I am all ears!
