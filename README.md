# Hey I am Jessica Sheleg

  Started off my career as a Mechanical Engineer with coding experience in C++ and Java from my BS in Engineering.
  After experience in Manfuacturing, Education and Sales, I decided to follow my passion to make a career change into Tech. 
  In January 2021, I started a certificate program in Data Science with a focus in Machine Learning using Python. 
  In April, I started a Full-Stack web development program with a focus on the MERN stack through [University of Texas Austin](https://techbootcamps.utexas.edu/coding/).
  Having graduated in October 2021, I am building my skills through personal projects and any opportunties that come along. 

I am currently reviewing the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, React and Node) and starting to refresh my knowledge on Java.
